      <p>The campaign’s message is that driving while using a mobile device is incredibly risky, but that it can be prevented very easily. It intends to get the reader more aware of the dangers associated with distracted driving, and what they can do to stop both themselves and those around them from doing it.</p>
      <p>The bold text at the top of the webpage is designed to grab the reader’s attention. The website targets a teenage audience by specifically making the information applicable to them, which draws teenagers in specifically. The website is also designed to have a lot of empty space, which makes it a lot easier to read and digest.</p>
